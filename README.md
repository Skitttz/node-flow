## 📌 Overview

NodeFlow is a structured roadmap for learning Node.js fundamentals, REST API development, SOLID principles, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and best practices modules from [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) and adjusted by Skittz

## 📍 Study Roadmap

🏕️ **Phase 1**: Node.js Fundamentals

Start with the foundation: Understand the core concepts of Node.js, including the event loop, asynchronous programming, and working with modules. This is where you set up your gear for the climb ahead!

⛰️ **Phase 2**: Building a REST API  

Build a complete REST API using modern tools and best practices. Implement [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety, [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) for high-performance routing, and [Knex](https://knexjs.org/) for database operations. This phase focuses on practical application development with current industry standards.

🌄 **Phase 3**: SOLID Principles 

Build a complete gym check-in 🏋🏽 system while learning SOLID principles and design patterns. Implement authentication with [JWT](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) and [Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/blog/refresh-tokens-what-are-they-and-when-to-use-them/), Role-Based Access Control [(RBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control), and database management with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). This phase combines architectural concepts with practical application.

🏗️ **Phase 4**: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) 

Develop a forum API while mastering DDD and Clean Architecture principles. Learn to design domain models, create value objects and relationships, implement use cases with functional error handling, and apply concepts like subdomains and domain events. All backed by unit testing to ensure code reliability.
